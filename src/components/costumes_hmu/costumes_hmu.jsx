        <h3>Costumes</h3>
        <p>
          Every costume item is provided by Disney. You will not be required to
          bring any costume items of your own.
        </p>
        <p>Despite them asking us 2-3 times already for measurements, they may well take your full measurements again during your first costume fitting, which may be as soon as day 1-2 of the contract.</p>
        <p>And fun note: the costume fitting is historically one of my favorite "I'm in China" moments of the contract, simply because of the sheer number of humans present for a single fitting. I swear: one year, there was a designer, a person who just held hangers, a person who just held safety pins, a person who just held the measuring tape, a person with a notepad taking notes from the designer, a person holding my shoes, a person holding my actual costume pieces, and like 3 apprentices just watching everything. This is what happens in a country with 1.3 billion people, people!</p>
        <h4>Prop note: Pitchpipes</h4>
        <p>
          If you own a pitchpipe (or two), pack them. Goode Time (and Disney)
          traditionally expect one of the boys to handle pitchpipe duties during
          performance. Ideally, each group has at least two pitchpipes
          available, in case one goes missing, is left in a costume pocket
          accidentally, etc.

        <h3>Makeup/Hair</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone will, at some point, have to do a makeup and hair
          consultation. Historically, the consultant looks at the men and says,
          "You don't need to do anything except put a little product in your
          hair" before turning attention to the women.

        <h3>Emilia's Notes For Sophisticated Disney Ladies</h3>
        <p>
          Hey everyone! Emilia here! Just wanted to drop in and give a quick
          overview to the women of the group about hair and makeup protocol at
          HKDL. Once we start jumping into rehearsals, the creative team will
          set aside one day for the makeup team to show us how to do our makeup,
          and for the hair team to put our hair in an updo and have it
          photographed for approval by creative. We will be receiving some basic
          makeup items like blush, lipstick, eyeshadow, eyeliner, brushes, and
          fake eyelashes.
        </p>
        <p className="special-note">
          Please note that these items are not of the highest quality and I
          highly recommend bringing some additional makeup supplies (including
          your own face products and foundation) as well as some fake eyelashes
          of your own. Historically I’ve brought a cheap sleeve of my own from
          Amazon and I think Sarah got the same one last year.{" "}
          <a href="https://a.co/d/8MnLTe0" target="_blank">
            Here’s what I’ve used
          </a>
          , but feel free to grab your favorite!
        </p>{" "}
        <h4>The Daily Hair/Makeup Routine</h4>
        <p>
          Once we get into tech and performance, we will be doing our own makeup
          every day. For Tree Lighting, we will get an updo every performance.
          The team will most likely use hot tools every day so it’s a very good
          idea to invest in a heat protector spray for your hair, especially if
          it has a hard time with daily hot tool use. We will get around an hour
          to an hour and fifteen minutes to do our hair and makeup each day. If
          we find that this is not enough time, we can let our stage managers
          know to push our call time back 15-30 minutes. We can feel it out
          during our tech and early performance schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          For caroling, we will be wigged, so prep your hair ahead of time for a
          wig as needed. I also invested in my own wig cap just in case I need
          an additional one or if the one they give us gets lost.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="special-note">
          Please note: During this time the men generally get to relax and do
          whatever the hell they want (Sean, for example, will take the time to
          see Mickey and the Wondrous Book every. single. morning.). I HIGHLY
          recommend sending them to do some act of service like grabbing us
          tasty treats from 7-11 or the cafeteria, or using this time to make up
          set lists for the day. They get a ton more down time than the women,
          so put them to work!!!
