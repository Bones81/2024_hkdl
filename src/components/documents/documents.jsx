          Documents: a cheat sheet.
        </h2>
          <p>
            In the work <strong>visa application</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>contract</strong> completion process, you will be asked to
            submit many documents: some as digital files, others as hard copies,
            and some in both forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will likely have to submit documents to both HKDL's¬†HR
            department and a company called Fragomen that helps us get our work
            visas from the Immigration Dept.
          </p>
        <h3 className="special-note">
          ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è By this point, all of us should have received
          our contracts from HKDL and our visa
          application materials from Fragomen, the agency handling our immigration
          cases. I know several of us have electronically signed our contracts and mailed off our visa application materials already. While we aren't in a huge rush yet, do not delay this process. If anything goes wrong, you'll need as much time as possible to ensure everything is approved before we leave for HK. 
          The visas take 4-6 weeks to process and approve. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

          Eventually, when you FedEx your visa application materials to HK,
          make sure you <em>save your receipt(s)</em>, and make sure you{" "}
          <em>bring those receipts with you to HK</em> so that Disney can
          reimburse you.

        <p>
          Here is a cheat sheet of all the appropriate paperwork to collect. Especially for newbies, it may
          take a hot minute to collect everything, so I recommend starting to
          collect these materials now so that you can mail them or email them as soon as possible. 
        </p>
        <h4 className="special-note">
          As of 2022, Hong Kong has been issuing digital e-visas instead of
          mailing us hard copies. These e-visas come with a QR code you should
          print and also save digitally.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, as of 2022, HKDL now allows you to complete your
          contract signing electronically. You may still need to print a hard
          copy of the signed contract to include with your visa application.

        <h4 className="special-note">Note that HK uses differently sized paper by default than we do in the US. They use "A4" while we use "US Letter." As a result, you may need to adjust your printer settings to ensure the larger A4 document completely fits onto US Letter-sized paper. This is particularly important for the visa application form, which contains an important barcode that will be cut off if the document is not resized to fit onto US Letter-sized paper.</h4>

          All of this is of course subject to change, and the info offered

          and your receipt from mailing your visa application materials.
